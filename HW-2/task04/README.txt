command:
./kitty_rev DRPKNF

The program checks for hash of the input, which is all uppercase and of fixed length, and compares the first 6 bytes with the predefined hash value. If the match is successful, the flag is printed out.

The script.py bruteforces to find the string such that the first six bytes of the hash value of the string matches the required string('cb1bbe').
